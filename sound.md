# Chapter 1. The Digital Representation of Sound, Part One: Sound and Timbre

## Physical / Psychophysical
* Frequency / Pitch
* Amplitude / Loudness

## Frequency
* F = repeats/second (Hz)
* Human ear can recognize the following frequencies: 20Hz – 20KHz
 
## Period
P = seconds/repeats
 
## Wavelength
W = `sonic speed (345 meters/second)` * `Period`

## Octave 2:1
* 20Hz – 40Hz
* 40Hz – 80Hz
* 80Hz – 160Hz
* ...

## A
55Hz, 110Hz, 220Hz, 440Hz, ...

## Fletcher-Munson Curves
Loudness of 50Hz tone at 55dB == loudness of 1000Hz at 20dB

# Chapter 2: The Digital Representation of Sound, Part Two: Playing by the Numbers

* ADC analog to digital converter – sound to samples
* DAC digital to analog converter – back to sound
* Analog is continuous, digital is discrete
* *Nyquist sampling theorem:* The sampling rate should be at least twice the highest frequency contained in the sound of the signal
